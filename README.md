# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to null and undefined values and presents a solution.

## The Problem

Many JavaScript functions fail silently or throw exceptions when they receive null or undefined arguments.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and debugging difficulties.

## The Solution

The best practice is to explicitly check for null and undefined values at the start of your function and handle them gracefully.  This might involve returning a default value, throwing an error with context, or using a conditional operator.
